## TODO

- Find out whether common environments have global `inputrc`,
  `bashrc`, or `bash_profile` scripts to be included in my
  versions, or what the delivery system should look like
- Figure out where bash-completion is for common environments
  - What typically should be installed for these to be available?
- Figure out the minimal gitconfig that can be applied to all
  systems that I interact with
- Look at GPG Agent Forwarding for SSH
